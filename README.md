# FastExtreid
FastextreID is a research platform that implements state-of-the-art feature extraction and re-identification algorithms.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Quick Start

The designed architecture follows this guide [PyTorch-Project-Template](https://github.com/L1aoXingyu/PyTorch-Project-Template), you can check each folder's purpose by yourself.

See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).

Learn more at out [documentation](https://fast-reid.readthedocs.io/). And see [projects/](projects) for some projects that are build on top of fastreid.

## Model Zoo and Baselines

We provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Fastreid Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Deployment

We provide some examples and scripts to convert fastreid model to Caffe, ONNX and TensorRT format in [Fastreid deploy](tools/deploy).

## License

Fastreid is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Citing FastReID
